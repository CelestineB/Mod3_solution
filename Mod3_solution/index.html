			Because this Bean manages its own database access and search, it
has to establish its own database connection. It cannot rely on the
container to do this.
The database connection is established by instantiating a static
Driver class and providing the getConnection method. The
getConnection method queries the static DriverManager class for a
registered database driver that matches the Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) . In this case, the URL is weblogic.jdbc.jts.Driver.
